# Meta-Forge 🧠⚙️
An intelligent AutoML engine that analyzes user datasets, identifies problem types, and recommends optimal machine learning models using meta-learning.

## 🚀 Overview
Meta-Forge automates the early stages of machine learning by:
- Detecting whether a dataset represents a **classification or regression** problem
- Extracting rich **statistical and structural meta-features**
- Applying reusable preprocessing pipelines
- Logging dataset characteristics and model performance to enable **meta-learning**

The goal is to reduce repetitive experimentation and guide model selection efficiently.
